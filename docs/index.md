# Installation Guide

These pages should help you to get started setting up the computing environment on your machine ready for the course "Programming Practices for Research in Economics" at the University of Zurich in **Fall 2024**.

**Please attempt to install necessary software and packages prior to the beginning of the course.**

* If everything goes smoothly, you should be able to complete the installation in one sitting which should take about 2 hours.
* Please follow the steps one-by-one in the order they appear on the sidebar and do not deviate from them, unless you really know what you are doing.
* If you find any outdated links or unclear descriptions, message us in [Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3AMA-STKx6h1juEjzbUJBHmqRpnR3fziZ9eonILMKzGL01%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=a57eafc0-f04b-4d0e-8013-fb868b027728&tenantId=c7e438db-e462-4c22-a90a-c358b16980b3) so that we can update the instructions or clarify as needed.

!!! Note "Department Managed Laptops"
    The department has stopped to provide users with admin rights for their laptops.  Anyone using one of those laptops won't be able to do run many of the commands used in this installation guide. We provide alternative solutions for installation and highlight those throughout the guide with notes like this. If there aren't any special notes for your device, just follow the normal installation guide.

!!! tip "Installation Help"
