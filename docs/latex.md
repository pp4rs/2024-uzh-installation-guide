# LaTeX

LaTeX is a document preparation system for high-quality typesetting most often used for medium-to-large technical or scientific documents.
Most of you probably have some familiarity with LaTeX from your Master's Theses.

We may want to build some PDF documents throughout the course using LaTeX - so let's install it.

!!! note "Department Managed Laptops"
        Latex can be install from the Software Center. Search for "Mactex" on Mac and "TeXLive" won Windows and install the most recent version.

## LaTeX Install for Mac

We again install from Homebrew.
Enter the following into the terminal:

```bash
brew install --cask mactex
```

## LaTeX Install for Linux

LaTeX can be installed from the terminal by entering the following command and pressing `Return`:

```bash
sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-extra
```

Check everything went according to plan:

``` bash
tex --version
```

which gives the following output:

``` bash
